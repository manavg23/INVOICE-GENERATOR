# Invoice Generator

A React-based web application designed for generating invoices with ease. This tool provides businesses with a straightforward and efficient way to create and manage invoices. With an intuitive interface, users can quickly input customer details, add items or services, and automatically calculate totals, including taxes and discounts. The application also allows users to print invoices directly, simplifying the entire invoicing process. It leverages [jspdf-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-react) to capture invoice data and convert it into a PDF.
